          I had worked along with Emeka during the initial phase of our venture which needed Web development. 
          He is a committed resource who has in depth knowledge about the domain. 
          He will be an asset for any organisation!

            Emeka is very reliable and easy to get along with. He is definitely someone who you would want to be in his team. 
            His presence alone brings high moral to any team.

            Emeka has worked on many projects throughout his career as a software developer. I have been privileged to be a team member in some of such projects.
            Emeka brings so much tenacity and hardwork to a team and makes sure that all team members are at the same pace with him.
            A true professional.

            Emeka is very skiled at coding and even better at problem solving. His ability to suggest solutions to pressing issues when you need them the most is highly commendable.
            He is fast, efficient, humble and very clever. His coding skills are second to none.
